## About me

<p style='text-align: justify;'>I am Duy Khanh Dinh, a Research Assistant at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). I graduated at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), which is one of the most famous universites in Vietnam. My major is Electronics and Telecommunications. In the final university year, I joined the Wireless Communication Laboratory under Assoc. Prof. Nguyen Van Duc and worked on Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) project with the responsibility of designing and deploying sensor systems in order to detect and classify vehicles. Before becomming a researcher at SUTD, I was a system software engineer at Samsung Vietnam Mobile R&D Center (SVMC), Samsung Electronics Vietnam (SEV). I had almost three years in the role of team leader of the Power Optimization Team. At SVMC, I got familiar with Linux Kernel and Operating System in terms of Tizen OS, which our own OS developed by Samsung. In early April 2017, I took the chance of becomming a Cyber Security Researcher at SUTD. I have worked on Cross-functional Information System for Decision Making (CISDeM) project. The PI of this project is Prof. David Yau.</p>
