## ABSTRACT

<p style='text-align: justify;'>"Designing and deploying a vehicle detection and classification system using ultrasonic sensors and microwave motion detectors for the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS)" is a track in the ITS project, which is a State-level science project under the supervision of a professional research scientist, Associate Professor Nguyen Van Duc. The aims and objectives of this project are to automatically detect and classify vehicles going through the Electronic Toll Collection System into predefined categories based on information about the length, width and height of the objects.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The first part of the thesis includes signal processing techniques in order to deal with the output of ultrasonic sensors, SRF05, combined with algorithms to get vehiclesâ€™ width and height. The final results are over 90% of accuracy in comparison with actual height of objects.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The methods to extract the length and speed of vehicles will be presented in the second part of the thesis. Signals from microwave motion detectors, namely HB100, will be filtered and amplified before going to a microcontroller. Finally, the microcontroller will pass the length and speed of objects to the controller for a decision-making process. The upper bound on the distance between an object and the sensor is 8(m) and vehicles should have the speed in the range from 5(km/h) to 40(km/h). The achieved results are over 80% of accuracy in comparison with the actual length of objects.</p>
